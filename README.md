# Text Analyzer

The python file—TextAnalyzer.py—runs an infrastructure for analyzing texts so they can be compared for similarity (i.e. in context, this could theoretically identify the author of an anonymous text). The file runs a TextAnalyzer class that reads in a file and does all the analysis needed to create the frequency fingerprint for that text. The program then runs test cases to test valididity of TextAnalyzer's assessment of the added files.
